It refers to anything related to computing technology, such as networking, hardware, software, the Internet, or the people that work with these technologies. Many companies now have IT departments for managing the computers, networks, and other technical areas of their businesses. IT jobs include Computer Programming, Network Administration, Computer Engineering, Web Development, Game Development, Graphic Designer, Animation, Robotics Engineering, Cyber Security, Technical Support, and many other related occupations.
